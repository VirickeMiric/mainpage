                Benefits of Raised Garden Beds
            </h2>
            <h4 class="mt-5">
                Better Soil Quality
            </h4>
            <p>                
                One of the primary advantages of raised garden beds is the ability to have greater control over the quality of your soil. You can choose the perfect mix of soil and compost to create a nutrient-rich environment that promotes healthy plant growth. This control over soil quality allows you to grow a wider variety of plants, including those that may not thrive in your native soil.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Improved Drainage
            </h4>
            <p>
                Raised garden beds typically have better drainage than traditional in-ground gardens. This means that excess water is less likely to accumulate and cause root rot or other moisture-related issues. Additionally, the improved drainage makes raised beds suitable for areas with heavy rainfall or clayey soils.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Extended Growing Season
            </h4>
            <p>
                Raised garden beds warm up faster in the spring, allowing you to start planting earlier in the season. Additionally, the elevated design helps retain heat, which can extend the growing season well into the fall, giving you the opportunity to harvest fresh produce for a more extended period.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Enhanced Pest Control
            </h4>
            <p>
                While no garden is entirely immune to pests, raised garden beds can be easier to protect from common garden intruders like slugs, snails, and certain ground-dwelling insects. Installing barriers or netting around the raised beds can deter these pests effectively.            
            </p>
            <h4>
                Aesthetically Pleasing Design
            </h4>
            <p>
                Aside from their practical advantages, raised garden beds can add a beautiful and organized touch to your landscape. They come in various materials, shapes, and sizes, allowing you to choose a design that complements your outdoor space. Raised beds can also be customized to match your personal style, enhancing the overall appearance of your garden.

            <h2 class="mt-3 pt-3">Building Your Raised Garden Bed</h2>
            
            <p>
                Now that you're aware of the benefits, here are steps to help you build your raised garden bed:
            </p>
            <ol>                
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Select a Location
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Choose a sunny spot in your garden where your plants will receive at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day. I recommend you to use a spot where shade is present to protect the plants from direct sunlight, and scorching during the summer.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Materials
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Select the material for your raised bed, such as wood, concrete blocks, or metal. Ensure that the chosen material is rot-resistant and safe for gardening. We used wood in my particular case and painted it with lenseed-oil which protects the wood from rotting.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Size and Height
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Determine the dimensions and height of your raised bed. Typical heights range from 12 to 24 inches, but you can adjust based on your preferences and accessibility needs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Assembly
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Construct the frame of your raised bed and secure it firmly in place. Ensure the bottom is free from weeds and grass by covering it with landscape fabric.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Fill
                </h4>
                <p>
                    To the bottow you can put chopped wood, the bigger chunks should go to the bottom. This should be around 30-40% of the total volume of the bed. Above this wood-layer should go some dried, cured grass, at least a week old, or any other greens like leaves , etc. It is even better if you cure the cut grass with water for a day before you add it to the raised-bed. This should be another 10-15%. After that you can put the soil . Fill your raised bed with a mixture of high-quality garden soil and compost. Aim for a well-draining and nutrient-rich blend. The soil will drain up to even 50%, sue to water, it will blend between the the beds other compartments, filling up even the smallest holes. Depending on the size of your bed, plan to refill the soil in the coming 1-2 years. This is a normal phenomenon.

                    Planting
                </h4>
                <p>
                    If you are doing your bed in the spring, make sure to wait at least 1-2 week before planting anything as the soil will keep draining. If needed, refill, than plant your chosen vegetables, herbs, flowers, or shrubs according to your gardening plan.
                </p>

                </h4>
                <p>
                    Apply mulch to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Water your raised bed regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
                </p>

                    Keep an eye on your raised garden bed, maintaining proper watering and addressing any issues like pests or nutrient deficiencies promptly.
